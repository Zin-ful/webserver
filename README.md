delete the executable and type "make" to recompile. the server will start on 8080 so you can just type http://localhost:8080 to go to the main page

if your windows doesnt have make then just compile handle_files into handle_http

this also has features that the current webpages dont support like file indexing and video playing, i just didnt include a webpage for those
